Ideally you either dowload this repository yourself and try out `demo.ipynb`, or, if you have docker installed, try the docker image `tobemo/demo` that can be found on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/tobemo/demo/tags) by:
1. opening a terminal and running `docker run -p 8888:8888 tobemo/demo`;
2. navigating to http://localhost:8888/notebooks/demo.ipynb;
