    "The more advanced version uses a second model that is trained on the start portions only of a stroke. <br>\n",
    "The difference can be noticed when drawing a $7$.\n",
    "The simple version considers $2$ a viable option while drawing which partially makes sense. The main difference between a $7$ and a $2$ is the bottom horizontal stroke, the absence of which dictates whether it is actually a $7$ or a $2$. That being said, the top horizontal stroke of a $7$ typically never curves upwards. It is either straight or has a downwards curve. The second model (which, again, focusses on the first portion of a stroke) is better at detecting this and never commits to predicting the number $2$.\n",
